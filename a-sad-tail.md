House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

I wish Ned Stark would have turned into John Candy. Then eat a record size steak. It was cooked over the campfire of his enemies.
